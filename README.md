A minimalist text editor

This is just a toy projet made to quickly do some small edit on config files and stuff like that.

To use it simpli compile it and you will have a single executable.
Use the executable with the file you want to edit as the first argument.
To acces help just press h while runing the program.

ASCatto is writen in C and the interface is made with ncurses.
