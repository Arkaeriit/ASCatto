# ASCatto
A minimalist text editor

This is just a toy project made to quickly do some small edit on config files and stuff like that.

To use it simply compile it with make and you will have a single executable. Use the executable with the file you want to edit as the first argument. To access help just press h while ruining the program.
To access help just press h while running the program.
